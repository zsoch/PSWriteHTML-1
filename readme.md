# PSWriteHTML - PowerShell Module

`PSWriteHTML` is fork of [ReportHTML](https://github.com/azurefieldnotes/ReportHTML/) module. I've forked [ReportHTML](https://github.com/azurefieldnotes/ReportHTML/) due to it being outdated and not maintained. I also wanted to address some problems it has and add more features. As it stands `PSWriteHTML` is complete rewrite and  doesn't use same naming convention as [ReportHTML](https://github.com/azurefieldnotes/ReportHTML/) or even same code, therefore you can have both. Keep in mind the approach on building html is much more simplified and I'm adding more and more features.

## How to install

While you can take sources and use it from here, **PSWriteHTML** actually is composed of multiple other of my modules. To get it up and running you will need ***PSSharedGoods**, and **PSSharedGoods** will need **Connectimo** and **PSWriteColor**. While **Connectimo** or **PSWriteColor** aren't needed for **PSWriteHTML**, **PSSharedGoods** uses them for some of the commands and it will fail without them. You can get all that from sources but if you **just want** to use my modules you should use `Install-Module` command. It's available in PowerShell 5.1. As an added bonus when I publish modules to **PowerShellGallery** I remove any junk, minimize modules to a single file which makes them faster to load and use. I really encourage you to use module from PowerShellGallery and treat **GitHub** as highely development version. Since version 0.0.61 when **PSWriteHTML** is published every dependency is baked into **PSWriteHTML**. That means you don't need to download any other modules unless you want to contribute to this project.

### To install

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSWriteHTML -AllowClobber -Force
```

Force and AllowClobber aren't necessary but they do skip errors in case some appear.

### And to update

```powershell
Update-Module -Name PSWriteHTML
```

That's it. Whenever there's new version you simply run the command and you can enjoy it. Remember, that you may need to close, reopen PowerShell session if you have already used module before updating it.

**The important thing** is if something works for you on production, keep using it till you test the new version on a test computer. I do changes that may not be big, but big enough that auto-update will break your code. For example, small rename to a parameter and your code stops working! Be responsible!

Dependencies: **PSSharedGoods**, **PSWriteColor** and **Connectimo** are only used during development. When published to PSGallery / Releases it's merged release without any dependencies.

- updated libraries
- bunch of different, new features
- easier building HTML

## Credits

[Matthew Quickenden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewquickenden/) ([@lucidqdreams](https://github.com/lucidqdreams)) - author of  ReportHTML - without him this wouldn't be possible.

## Projects using PSWriteHTML (to give you ideas what you can do)

- [Statusimo](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Statusimo) is a PowerShell module that is able to generate a Status Page entirely from PowerShell.
- [Dashimo](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Dashimo) is a PowerShell module that makes generating Dashboards, nice looking HTML, a breeze.
- [Emailimo](https://github.com/EvotecIT/Emailimo) is a PowerShell module that makes writting nice looking HTML emails, easy!
- [Out-HTMLView](https://evotec.xyz/out-htmlview-html-alternative-to-out-gridview/) is a PowerShell cross-platform command alternative to Out-GridView

![Out-HTMLView](https://evotec.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Out-HtmlView.gif)

Following external libaries and frameworks are in use. They make `PSWriteHTML` what it is now. This list is dynamic and doesn't cover everything yet.

For colors you can visit this [online page](https://evotec.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-Colors.html).

## 3rd Party Libraries

**PSWriteHTML** uses some 3rd party libraries to deliver it's functionality. It requires those. There are two ways to use it

- With links to CSS/JS which makes code cleaner and easy to see what is happening
- With code inline in HTML which makes HTML much bigger

Below you can find some of 3rd party libraries being used.

### External JS Framework - DataTables

Following JS Framework is intergrated as part of this module. It's responsible for building Tables
